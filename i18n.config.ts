        intro: `Welcome to the exciting journey of mastering Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) through a fun and interactive hide-and-seek game! This tutorial is designed to guide you through the fundamentals of MARL using the PettingZoo library, combined with other powerful tools like AgileRL, PyTorch, PyGame, and python-dotenv. Whether you're a seasoned ML practitioner or just starting out, this chapter will set the groundwork for a thrilling adventure in the world of reinforcement learning (RL).`,
